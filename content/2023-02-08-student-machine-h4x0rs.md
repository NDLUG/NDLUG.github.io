Our last dblitt LUG meeting keynote got raving reviews, so we thought that we would exploit our content creation factory once more this week to save our declining metrics (the AI said it, not me... ðŸ˜¶).

For the first meeting of the spring semester (and the start of a 2-part series on using the student machines at ND like a h4x0r), we rounded up our most elite student machine secrets to present and share (no gatekeeping ðŸ’¯). Topics included ssh-ing like a pro (including jumpbox and config files), tmuxing to boost productivity, vimming like a boss, and learning how to use VSCode in a manner that is polite to the student machines.

All of dblitt's presentation materials can be found [here], and we look forward to continuing with the next installment of the "Student Machines Go Brrr" series.
