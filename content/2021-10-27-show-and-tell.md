After a two week hiatus due to midterms and fall break, we met to discuss our experiences
participating in Hacktoberfest. In our [previous meeting], we had outlined what Hacktoberfest is
and how to get involved, so this meeting served as a bookend to wrap-up and share what we did
during the month.

Most of our contributions were to the [Control-Alt-Delete] repository, the set of collaborative
programming challenges centered around a story about [Tux] and [Beastie]. We had contributions
in several different programming languages, as well as some fun art made with [GIMP]. As busy as
this month was, we had multiple members reach the 4 contribution threshold to order a free t-shirt.
Free is good, in both software and t-shirts!
