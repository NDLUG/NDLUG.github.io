For our first meeting of the year, we introduced our new LUG officers and hosted a panel where our board members shared their experiences with recruiting, interviewing, and working in internships (with a tad on their open source interactions in real life)

Panelists included:

1. John Sullivan ([The Aerospace Corporation], *LUG President*)
2. Daniel Blittschau ([Microsoft], *LUG Vice President*)
3. Anna Klempay ([NDCRC], *LUG Treasurer*)
4. Sebastian Gutierrez ([Robinhood], *LUG Secretary*)
5. Selina Nie ([Kimberly-Clark], *LUG Media Relations Officer*)
6. Jon Abbott ([Microsoft], *Senior LUG Member/Ally*)

During the panel discussion, the floor was opened for all attendees to ask our panel questions about the job application process, career development advice, and for any general wisdom.  Here are some of the highlights:

- LeetCode will be a part of your recruiting journey to some extent. Some might call it a "necessary evil" 
- Mixed opinions on returning to the same company for an internship or full-time. While returning to familiar relationships and opportunities can be great, it may come at the cost of not gaining valuable long-term career perspective (a trade-off, like most things in computer science ðŸ˜›).
- There is no one path to finding a job. Opportunities can come from networking, conferences and career fairs, as well as websites like Handshake â€” not just traditional applications.

Of course, the most important question asked that entire evening *by far*:
> _Did you encounter linux or open source in any of your experiences this past summer?_

- jabbott4: worked on a powershell module to interact with an open source package manager ([winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/))
- alkie: used the open source [chromium browser](https://www.chromium.org/Home/) during her time researching and performing dark web data collection with the CRC
- sebmaster36: learned about [Apache Kafka's](https://kafka.apache.org/) role in multiple facets of Robinhood's service stacks
