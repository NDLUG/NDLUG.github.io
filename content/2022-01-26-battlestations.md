As a complement to our [ricing showcase](2021-11-17-ricing-unix.html), this week's
meeting featured a tour of our members' battlestations. What is a battlestation?
It's how and where you do your computing, whether that's a humble laptop at your desk
or a custom-built gaming rig with multiple monitors and RGBs aplenty.

For example, here is Linus Torvalds' treadmill desk battlestation:
