For our final meeting of the fall semester we discussed [Advent of Code], an online
Advent calendar of programming challenges which has gained large popularity.

The daily puzzles come in two parts and become gradually more difficult as the month
progresses. This presents a great opportunity to learn a new programming language,
compete with others, or just have fun solving interesting problems. On the private
leaderboard for NDLUG members, we had several people complete over half of the
challenges!

We wrote solutions in JavaScript, Python (normally and [code golfed]), Go, Swift,
and Haskell, to name a few. Comparing problem-solving approaches and code snippets
with each other made for lively discussion in our club's [IRC server].

Join us next year for AoC 2022!
