Inspired by a recent episode of the [Linux After Dark](https://linuxafterdark.net/linux-after-dark-episode-10/) podcast,
we decided to discuss when it is reasonable (if ever) to submit to using non-FOSS
solutions in our lives. Generally, all of us agreed that sometimes it is okay to
be pragmatic and use proprietary software and devices, though to what extent was
a point of contention.

A large contingent of the club uses iPhones, for example, citing vendor lock-in
and extolling the "just works" nature of Apple products. Is this forgivable?

Some members debated whether gaming is an appropriate time to set aside one's
principles. Is playing closed-source video games on Linux an acceptable
compromise, or should we reject this incongruence?

Is fiddling around with free software always worth the hours out of your life?
Everyone has a breaking point -- what's yours?
