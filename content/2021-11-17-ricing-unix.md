One major focus among users of Linux (and other Unix-like operating systems) is the
customization of their workflow and visual environment, often referred to as "**ricing**."
Our members met this week to show off and compare their rices, and eat some delicous
fried rice!

We had a vast range of setups, such as [GNOME] desktops tweaked with extensions,
minimal window managers like [i3wm] and [bspwm], and of course an [emacs] configuration
that can somehow do everything. We also had a macOS rice built on top of [yabai]!
Applications displayed included [neofetch], [asciiquarium], and [pipes.sh]. One of our
members even wrote a [dynamic wallpaper setter], a useful tool for ricers.
