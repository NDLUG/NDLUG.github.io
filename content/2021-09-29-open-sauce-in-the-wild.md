For our third meeting we gave our LUG members an assignment to share their 
favorite FOSS that they have used or use regularly. We began with an 
example of Linux and open source software in action by watching a video 
about the Ingenuity helicopter that was attached to the Perseverance rover.

There were many interesting and intriguing pieces of software shared amongst
the group. It was fun to see how many different options there are out there
in the wild. Here are the top FOSS used by the 15 LUG members in attendance:

1. [Android]
2. [Firefox]
3. [GIMP]
4. [Shotcut]
5. [Xournal++]
6. [c:geo]
7. [Blender]
8. [Anki]
9. [Wireguard]
10. [React]
11. [Windows Terminal]
12. [Qutebrowser]
13. [Weechat]
14. [i3]
15. [Newsboat]
16. [Radicale] + [calcurse]
17. [Emacs]
18. [Inkscape]
19. [LibreOffice]
20. [Bitwarden]
21. [Joplin]
22. [Minetest]

Many of these are used because of their freedom and openness. They allow users 
to customize their experience in any way they wish; to improve it for their 
needs. There are plenty of free and open software alternatives to applications 
from big tech companies such as Google, Apple, and the like. A lot of these 
are lightweight and quick programs that have fanbases to help with whatever 
issues occur. In celebration of FOSS we had Raising Cane's at the meeting!
