Last weekend, club officers **dblitt**, **alkie**, and **snie** welcomed first
year engineering students to Notre Dame and the Linux Users Group!  Besides
talking about Notre Dame, the officers also discused how [NDLUG] is focused on
celebrating:

1. **Open Source** technology and in particular [Linux].  It is a space for
   *geeking* out, *flame wars*, and of course *sharing knowledge*.

2. **Computer Science** and in particular the [CSE] department at Notre Dame.
   Though there are non-[CSE] majors in the group, the club serves as an
   *unofficial* water cooler for department and university *ongoings*.
   
3. **Community**.  The heart of the club, though, is the members and the
   support and encouragement they provide one another.  As with **Open
   Source**, what makes [NDLUG] special is the people and those who contribute
   and participate in it.
   
The officers are always happy to welcome new members into this **community**.
