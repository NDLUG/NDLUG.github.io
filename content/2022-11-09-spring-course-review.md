It has become tradition for the storied officers and friends of LUG to get together and combine their rich perspectives to offer a review of the [CSE department's](https://cse.nd.edu/) course offerings. With the 2023 spring semester fast approaching, we thought dedicating today's meeting to that purpose would be very fitting.  A special thank you goes out to all of the panelists whose valuable insights made today's discussion incredibly helpful and informative <3.

A recording of the meeting may be found below:

Please note that any advice or recommendations made during the discussion are the opinions of the speakers based on personal experiences that may vary depending on individual circumstances. 

Of the courses we reviewed and the ensuing discussions, we found the following areas to be especially valuable: 
- course sequencing for optimal SWE/career readiness or balanced workloads
- thoughts on taking challenging but rewarding courses while at ND
- general wisdom and success strategies for particular courses, etc.

For these and any specifics regarding a particular course, please feel free to consult the recording!
