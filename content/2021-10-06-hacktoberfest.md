In our first meeting of October, we learned about and discussed our plans for
[Hacktoberfest], an event which its host [Digital Ocean] describes as a "month-long
celebration of open source software[^1]." Now in its eighth year, the event invites
participants to make contributions to opted-in repositories on [GitHub] or [GitLab].
The first 50,000 people to make four approved pull requests earn a (free!) t-shirt
and stickers. Professor Bui gave a presentation on how to use [Git], a distributed
version control system that is integral to many software projects and to the Hacktoberfest
workflow.

In addition to promoting contributions to projects broadly, our club has created a
repository in which members can collaborate on solving a series of programming challenges. 
[Control-Alt-Delete](https://github.com/NDLUG/control-alt-delete) invites programmers
to complete five challenges to help [Tux] escape [Beastie]'s [jail]! Welcome contributions
include new solutions, improvements to existing solutions, testing, documentation, and
additions to the story. We've already had some creative solutions from members in
languages such as [JavaScript], [Haskell], and [C]. Happy Hacktoberfest -- now get hacking!
