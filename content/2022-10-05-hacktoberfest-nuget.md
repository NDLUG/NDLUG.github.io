For our first October meeting of the year, we hosted our annual intro and kick-off to [Hacktoberfest], a month-long celebration of open source software hosted by [Digital Ocean]. Hacktoberfest invites participants to make contributions to opted-in repositories on [GitHub] or [GitLab], and the first 50,000 people to make four approved pull requests earn a free t-shirt and stickers.  It is a great way to get involved with the open-source community, build skills, collaborate with others, and give back.  Some repositories that NDLUG members have loved to contribute to over the years during hacktoberfest include [Bobbit](https://github.com/NDLUG/bobbit) and the collection of [member scripts](https://github.com/NDLUG/member-scripts) on our GitHib [org page](https://github.com/NDLUG). 


We were also excited to share a special announcement just in time for Hacktoberfest. ND grad, former LUG member, and current Microsoft employee Camila Thompson shared with us an opportunity to contribute to [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/), a package manager for C# that her team at Microsoft that works with â€” they are actively looking for PRs [here]!  This is a great opportunity to contribute to a widely-used package manager and gain experience working with C# and .NET. 

Happy hacking and get those t-shirts, NDLUG.
