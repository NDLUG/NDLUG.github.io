This meeting was our first in-person gathering of the semester,
and pizza was back on the menu!

LUG sysadmin Tom gave a brief presentation about package managers, which
was followed by some discussion on the topic. Is pacman really so great?
Is flatpak the future? Does the Python community really need to stop making
new package management standards? Yes, maybe, and definitely yes!
