# NDLUG Blog

[ndlug.org](http://ndlug.org/) is the blog for the Notre Dame Linux
User Group. We have new talks and presentations approximately every week,
and our blog not only serves as documentation/notes for each meeting, but
is also a place welcome to anyone to share their ideas and thoughts to the
community.
