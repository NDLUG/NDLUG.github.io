        <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>After a long hiatus, we held our first in-person meeting of the year. The theme: celebrating the 30th anniversary of Linus Torvald’s email announcing his now-famous operating system. Professor Bui kicked off the meeting with a brief <a href=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xNAF_xXq0gYsokWBv1xVn70Y-1P0F-sgW6ObZliPXxg/edit?usp=sharing>presentation</a> about the club, its values, and the origins of Linux and free software. Then our president, Nolan, outlined some upcoming club events, such as an internship panel and an “open sauce in the wild” meeting. Officers led a discussion about members’ favorite Linux memories, which ranged from triumphant first installs on bare metal to PEBKAC-induced system breakages. No birthday party is complete without a cake (or party hats!), which was promptly cut and consumed over delightful conversation. With a headcount of 15 and the enthusiasm of ten times that, it’s safe to call this meeting a success.</p> <p><img src=../assets/img/discussion.jpg alt=members discussing linux memories></p> <p><img src=../assets/img/cake.jpg alt=cake!></p> ]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>For our second meeting, we invited a number of former and current LUG members to come and talk about their experiences using Linux and Open Source during their internships or in their careers.</p> <p>Guest Speakers included:</p> <ol type=1> <li>Michael Eisemann (<a href=https://www.nsa.gov/>NSA</a>, <em>LUG President Emeritus</em>)</li> <li>Sam Battalio (<a href=https://www.purestorage.com/>Pure Storage</a>, <em>LUG Officer emeritus</em>)</li> <li>Conor Nailos (<a href=https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en.html>Deloitte</a>, <em>LUG Officer emeritus</em>)</li> <li>Emory Smith (<a href=https://lucata.com/>Lucata</a>, <em>LUG Member emeritus</em>)</li> <li>Zephan Enciso (<a href=https://cse.nd.edu>ND CSE</a>, <em>LUG Officer emeritus</em>)</li> <li>Nolan McShea (<a href=https://www.hp.com>HP</a>, <em>LUG President</em>)</li> <li>John Sullivan (<a href=https://aerospace.org/>Aerospace Corporation</a>, <em>LUG Officer</em>)</li> <li>Joshua Tabar (Startup, <em>LUG Ally</em>)</li> <li>Jacob Mozdzen (<a href=https://microsoft.com>Microsoft</a>, <em>LUG Ally</em>)</li> </ol> <p>Along with our 9 panelists, we had about 15 members in attendance to learn and discuss Linux and open source with our guest speakers. Highlights from the meeting include:</p> <ul> <li>Linux commands come in handy such as grep, cut, and others.</li> <li>Operating system principles help to understand the ideas in industry.</li> <li>Even navigating at a basic level on a Linux machine is extremely helpful, especially if you know how to read documentation and figure things out. </li> <li>You will inevitably hit red tape because some companies don’t want you doing whatever you want. Find ways to work around it or have other projects  to work on as well.</li> <li>Linux+ certificate may not matter as much. It can be better just by doing and working on projects. It depends a bit on the industry too - for example it may be more relevant for consultants to have certifications.</li> </ul> <p>Of course, you can catch all the wisdom of our panelists by watching the record on <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pElotTEEm6Q>YouTube</a>:</p> <div style=text-align: center> <iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/pElotTEEm6Q title=YouTube video player frameborder=0 allow=accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture allowfullscreen> </iframe> </div> ]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>For our third meeting we gave our LUG members an assignment to share their favorite FOSS that they have used or use regularly. We began with an example of Linux and open source software in action by watching a video about the Ingenuity helicopter that was attached to the Perseverance rover.</p> <p>There were many interesting and intriguing pieces of software shared amongst the group. It was fun to see how many different options there are out there in the wild. Here are the top FOSS used by the 15 LUG members in attendance:</p> <ol type=1> <li><a href=https://www.android.com/>Android</a></li> <li><a href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/>Firefox</a></li> <li><a href=https://www.gimp.org/>GIMP</a></li> <li><a href=https://shotcut.org/>Shotcut</a></li> <li><a href=https://xournalpp.github.io/>Xournal++</a></li> <li><a href=https://www.cgeo.org/>c:geo</a></li> <li><a href=https://www.blender.org/>Blender</a></li> <li><a href=https://apps.ankiweb.net/>Anki</a></li> <li><a href=https://www.wireguard.com/>Wireguard</a></li> <li><a href=https://reactjs.org/>React</a></li> <li><a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/>Windows Terminal</a></li> <li><a href=https://qutebrowser.org/>Qutebrowser</a></li> <li><a href=https://weechat.org/>Weechat</a></li> <li><a href=https://i3wm.org/>i3</a></li> <li><a href=https://newsboat.org/>Newsboat</a></li> <li><a href=https://radicale.org/3.0.html>Radicale</a> + <a href=https://calcurse.org/>calcurse</a></li> <li><a href=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>Emacs</a></li> <li><a href=https://inkscape.org/>Inkscape</a></li> <li><a href=https://www.libreoffice.org/>LibreOffice</a></li> <li><a href=https://bitwarden.com/>Bitwarden</a></li> <li><a href=https://joplinapp.org/>Joplin</a></li> <li><a href=https://www.minetest.net/>Minetest</a></li> </ol> <p>Many of these are used because of their freedom and openness. They allow users to customize their experience in any way they wish; to improve it for their needs. There are plenty of free and open software alternatives to applications from big tech companies such as Google, Apple, and the like. A lot of these are lightweight and quick programs that have fanbases to help with whatever issues occur. In celebration of FOSS we had Raising Cane’s at the meeting!</p> <p><img src=../assets/img/2021-09-29-sauce.jpg alt=Saucy!></p> ]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>In our first meeting of October, we learned about and discussed our plans for <a href=https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/>Hacktoberfest</a>, an event which its host <a href=https://www.digitalocean.com/>Digital Ocean</a> describes as a “month-long celebration of open source software<a href=#fn1 class=footnote-ref id=fnref1 role=doc-noteref><sup>1</sup></a>.” Now in its eighth year, the event invites participants to make contributions to opted-in repositories on <a href=https://github.com/>GitHub</a> or <a href=https://gitlab.com/>GitLab</a>. The first 50,000 people to make four approved pull requests earn a (free!) t-shirt and stickers. Professor Bui gave a presentation on how to use <a href=https://git-scm.com/>Git</a>, a distributed version control system that is integral to many software projects and to the Hacktoberfest workflow.</p> <p>In addition to promoting contributions to projects broadly, our club has created a repository in which members can collaborate on solving a series of programming challenges. <a href=https://github.com/NDLUG/control-alt-delete>Control-Alt-Delete</a> invites programmers to complete five challenges to help <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux_(mascot)>Tux</a> escape <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_Daemon>Beastie</a>’s <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD_jail>jail</a>! Welcome contributions include new solutions, improvements to existing solutions, testing, documentation, and additions to the story. We’ve already had some creative solutions from members in languages such as <a href=https://github.com/NDLUG/control-alt-delete/blob/master/challenge00/solution-dblitt.js>JavaScript</a>, <a href=https://github.com/NDLUG/control-alt-delete/blob/master/challenge01/solution-herbertmcsnout.hs>Haskell</a>, and <a href=https://github.com/NDLUG/control-alt-delete/blob/master/challenge02/solution-jabbott4.c>C</a>.

In our <a href=https://ndlug.org/posts/2021-10-06-hacktoberfest.html>previous meeting</a>, we had outlined what Hacktoberfest is and how to get involved, so this meeting served as a bookend to wrap-up and share what we did during the month.</p> <p>Most of our contributions were to the <a href=https://github.com/NDLUG/control-alt-delete>Control-Alt-Delete</a> repository, the set of collaborative programming challenges centered around a story about <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux_(mascot)>Tux</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_Daemon>Beastie</a>. We had contributions in several different programming languages, as well as some fun art made with <a href=https://www.gimp.org/>GIMP</a>. As busy as this month was, we had multiple members reach the 4 contribution threshold to order a free t-shirt. Free is good, in both software and t-shirts!</p> <p><img src=../assets/img/hacktoberfest-h.png alt=Hacktoberfest H logo></p> ]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Of all the Linux distributions out there, perhaps none is more memed than <a href=https://archlinux.org/>Arch Linux</a>. Arch is billed as a lightweight and customizable distro that tries to abide by the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle>KISS</a> philosophy.<a href=#fn1 class=footnote-ref id=fnref1 role=doc-noteref><sup>1</sup></a> Some of its most compelling offerings are the high quality <a href=https://wiki.archlinux.org/>wiki</a>, which is applicable for users of every distro, and the <a href=https://aur.archlinux.org/>AUR</a>, a large collection of build scripts for software outside the official package repositories.</p> <p>Installation of Arch is sometimes considered difficult, because it requires more involvment from the user than other distros. But in reality, anyone can install it by following the well-written <a href=https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide>installation guide</a>. Our club decided to install it together in order to learn more about the steps of the process that more traditional installers do on the user’s behalf.</p> <p>We used <a href=https://github.com/wimpysworld/quickemu>Quickemu</a>, a wrapper around <a href=https://www.qemu.org/>QEMU</a>, to easily spin up a virtual machine for an Arch install. Then we proceeded through the installation steps, which included connecting to the internet, updating the system clock, creating and formatting and mounting partitions, and using the <a href=https://man.archlinux.org/man/pacstrap.8>pacstrap</a> utility to install the base set of packages. After some more configuration, setting our root password, and choosing our bootloader, we managed to install <a href=https://www.x.org/>Xorg</a> to get a minimal graphical interface. From here we could install a desktop environment or a more complete window manager than the default one, but that can be a task for a future meeting.</p> <p><img src=../assets/img/archmemes.png alt=Arch Linux memes></p> <section class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes> <hr /> <ol> <li id=fn1 role=doc-endnote><p>For a different distribution’s take on this principle, see <a href=https://kisslinux.org/>Kiss Linux</a><a href=#fnref1 class=footnote-back role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a></p></li> </ol> </section> ]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>This week’s meeting took the form of a livestream on our <a href=https://www.twitch.tv/ndlug>Twitch channel</a>. Registration for <a href=https://registrar.nd.edu/students/registration_spring.php>Spring 2022</a> is fast approaching, so President Nolan, Vice President Paul, and Advisor Professor Bui led a discussion of the <a href=https://cse.nd.edu/>CSE Department</a>’s course offerings for the upcoming semester.</p> <p>Of particular interest were the elective courses, which include “Computer Graphics”, “Hardware for Learning,” and “Open Source Software Development.” Current undergrads, graduate students, and alumni kept the Twitch chat busy with questions, comments, and recommendations. I’m sure this stream will be of great use to anyone unsure of what to take next semester. Because this blog post’s author is not a CSE major, that’s about all the detail I can give you.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>One major focus among users of Linux (and other Unix-like operating systems) is the customization of their workflow and visual environment, often referred to as “<strong>ricing</strong>.” Our members met this week to show off and compare their rices, and eat some delicous fried rice!</p> <p>We had a vast range of setups, such as <a href=https://www.gnome.org/>GNOME</a> desktops tweaked with extensions, minimal window managers like <a href=https://i3wm.org/>i3wm</a> and <a href=https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm>bspwm</a>, and of course an <a href=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>emacs</a> configuration that can somehow do everything.

This presents a great opportunity to learn a new programming language, compete with others, or just have fun solving interesting problems. On the private leaderboard for NDLUG members, we had several people complete over half of the challenges!</p> <p>We wrote solutions in JavaScript, Python (normally and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf>code golfed</a>), Go, Swift, and Haskell, to name a few.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Inspired by a recent episode of the <a href=https://linuxafterdark.net/linux-after-dark-episode-10/>Linux After Dark</a> podcast, we decided to discuss when it is reasonable (if ever) to submit to using non-FOSS solutions in our lives. Generally, all of us agreed that sometimes it is okay to be pragmatic and use proprietary software and devices, though to what extent was a point of contention.</p> <p>A large contingent of the club uses iPhones, for example, citing vendor lock-in and extolling the “just works” nature of Apple products. Is this forgivable?</p> <p>Some members debated whether gaming is an appropriate time to set aside one’s principles. Is playing closed-source video games on Linux an acceptable compromise, or should we reject this incongruence?</p> <p>Is fiddling around with free software always worth the hours out of your life? Everyone has a breaking point – what’s yours?</p> ]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>For our first meeting of the year, we introduced our new LUG officers and hosted a panel where our board members shared their experiences with recruiting, interviewing, and working in internships (with a tad on their open source interactions in real life)</p> <p>Panelists included:</p> <ol type=1> <li>John Sullivan (<a href=https://aerospace.org/>The Aerospace Corporation</a>, <em>LUG President</em>)</li> <li>Daniel Blittschau (<a href=https://microsoft.com>Microsoft</a>, <em>LUG Vice President</em>)</li> <li>Anna Klempay (<a href=https://crc.nd.edu/>NDCRC</a>, <em>LUG Treasurer</em>)</li> <li>Sebastian Gutierrez (<a href=https://robinhood.com/us/en/>Robinhood</a>, <em>LUG Secretary</em>)</li> <li>Selina Nie (<a href=https://www.kimberly-clark.com/en-us/>Kimberly-Clark</a>, <em>LUG Media Relations Officer</em>)</li> <li>Jon Abbott (<a href=https://microsoft.com>Microsoft</a>, <em>Senior LUG Member/Ally</em>)</li> </ol> <p>During the panel discussion, the floor was opened for all attendees to ask our panel questions about the job application process, career development advice, and for any general wisdom. Here are some of the highlights:</p> <ul> <li>LeetCode will be a part of your recruiting journey to some extent. Some might call it a “necessary evil”</li> <li>Mixed opinions on returning to the same company for an internship or full-time. While returning to familiar relationships and opportunities can be great, it may come at the cost of not gaining valuable long-term career perspective (a trade-off, like most things in computer science 😛).</li> <li>There is no one path to finding a job. Opportunities can come from networking, conferences and career fairs, as well as websites like Handshake — not just traditional applications.</li> </ul> <p>Of course, the most important question asked that entire evening <em>by far</em>: &gt; <em>Did you encounter linux or open source in any of your experiences this past summer?</em></p> <ul> <li>jabbott4: worked on a powershell module to interact with an open source package manager (<a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/>winget</a>)</li> <li>alkie: used the open source <a href=https://www.chromium.org/Home/>chromium browser</a> during her time researching and performing dark web data collection with the CRC</li> <li>sebmaster36: learned about <a href=https://kafka.apache.org/>Apache Kafka’s</a> role in multiple facets of Robinhood’s service stacks</li> </ul> <p>Of course, you can catch all the wisdom of our panelists by watching the recording [here]](https://bruh.com):</p> <div style=text-align: center> <iframe width=560 height=315 src title frameborder=0 allow=accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture allowfullscreen> </iframe> </div> ]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Today we celebrated the 31st birthday of the operating system that has revolutionized the world of technology - Linux. And just like last year, we celebrated it with much fanfare, (cup)cakes, and a slideshow that might look a little familiar.</p> <p>Our beloved Professor Bui kicked off the meeting with the reason for the season: the origins of Linux and the hacker ethic that brought it to life. Club members reminisced about their favorite Linux memories, from privacy and hackability (zenciso) to learning about Linux from fellow members like dblitt (cbowers4). Our personal favorite was jabbott’s memory of the argument between Tanenbaum and Torvalds where Torvalds equated himself to Albert Einstein (🤓).</p> <p><img src=../assets/img/2022-09-14-yearly-birthdays-meme.jpg alt=satirical birthday tweet></p> <p>Birthdays can get a little old, so this year we decided to spice things up. Instead of just reminiscing, we gave *nix a little roast in true birthday fashion. We shared hilarious Linux memes that we found on the internet and did not hold back (sorry Arch). It was a great way to celebrate the OS we all know and love.</p> <p>As for the cupcakes, they were delicious, and we can’t wait to do it all again next year. Even though it might seem silly to celebrate an operating system’s birthday every year, Linux is much more than just software - it’s a symbol of the hacker ethic, of open-source, and of a community that believes in the power of collaboration.</p> <p>Here’s to another year of celebrating Linux and all that it has brought to our lives! (not /s)</p> <p>Some of our favorite memes from the evening:</p> <p><img src=../assets/img/2022-09-14-linux-users-fish.jpg alt=most reasonable linux user> <img src=../assets/img/2022-09-14-linux-gamers.jpg alt=most entertained linux gamer> <img src=../assets/img/2022-09-14-linux-users-web-browser.jpg alt=least sophisticated foss browser></p> <p><img src= alt=> <img src= alt=></p> ]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>At our recent LUG meeting, resident gigabrain and living member of the endangered “officer that runs linux” species Daniel Blittschau (<em>aka dblitt</em>) took the floor to share his experiences using Linux at Notre Dame. Below are some of the highlights of the meeting:</p> <p>Why use linux? - CLI efficiency - Customizability and control over your system - Avoiding dependence on student machines and resources</p> <p>Before making the switch to Linux, it’s important to consider your needs and use cases. Ask yourself: - What do you use your computer for? - Are there Linux alternatives to the software you use? (we’re looking at you, niche enterprise software…) - How committed do I want to be? (dual boot? VM? nuclear on bare metal?)</p> <p>For all of those moved by dblitt’s oratorical prowess, the following pieces of advice were offered to any linux considerers: - Most enterprise laptops will do just fine, but a laptop that’s 1-2 years old (or some extensive hardware research before proceding) will yield a smoother experience - WSL can be faster, but different system calls can be an issue for CS classes - Save yourself from live linux environments (e.g. two flash drive janky boot 🤢)</p> <p>If you’re interested in using Linux at Notre Dame, we hope you found this presentation helpful. With the right tools and guidance, making the switch to Linux can offer greater efficiency, control, and customization over your personal computer. Of course, all of dblitt’s lovely presentation materials can be found <a href=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L55bzNLTTFaSWc2EX3Ha3NVi5qTEd7mS-d0rcvz0n94/edit?usp=sharing>here</a>.</p> <p><img src= alt=></p> ]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>For our first October meeting of the year, we hosted our annual intro and kick-off to <a href=https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/>Hacktoberfest</a>, a month-long celebration of open source software hosted by <a href=https://www.digitalocean.com/>Digital Ocean</a>. Hacktoberfest invites participants to make contributions to opted-in repositories on <a href=https://github.com/>GitHub</a> or <a href=https://gitlab.com/>GitLab</a>, and the first 50,000 people to make four approved pull requests earn a free t-shirt and stickers. It is a great way to get involved with the open-source community, build skills, collaborate with others, and give back. Some repositories that NDLUG members have loved to contribute to over the years during hacktoberfest include <a href=https://github.com/NDLUG/bobbit>Bobbit</a> and the collection of <a href=https://github.com/NDLUG/member-scripts>member scripts</a> on our GitHib <a href=https://github.com/NDLUG>org page</a>.</p> <p>We were also excited to share a special announcement just in time for Hacktoberfest. ND grad, former LUG member, and current Microsoft employee Camila Thompson shared with us an opportunity to contribute to <a href=https://www.nuget.org/>NuGet</a>, a package manager for C# that her team at Microsoft that works with — they are actively looking for PRs <a href=https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahacktoberfest>here</a>! This is a great opportunity to contribute to a widely-used package manager and gain experience working with C# and .NET.</p> <p>Happy hacking and get those t-shirts, NDLUG.</p> <p><img src=../assets/img/hacktoberfest-tux-and-beastie.png alt=Hacktoberfest logo with Tux and Beastie></p> ]]></content>

If celebrating the month-long extravaganza of Hacktoberfest was not enough to satisfy our hacking hunger, December presents us with another occasion to celebrate the community we love so much. AoC is an online Advent calendar of two-part daily programming challenges that becomes gradually more difficult as the month progresses. This presents a great (and festive ⛄️) opportunity to learn a new programming language, compete with others, or just have fun solving interesting problems.</p> <p>As a club, NDLUG regularly engages with Advent of Code. You might find us comparing problem-solving approaches or engaging in competitive banter regarding the <a href=https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/private/view/181542>leaderboard</a> in club’s <a href=https://regserv.ndlug.org/>IRC server</a>. Be sure to sign up if you wish to take part in either of those 👀.</p> <p>If you happened to have missed us, be sure to join us next year for AoC 2023! You don’t want to miss out.</p> <p>Meeting slides can be found <a href=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lfu3v0LfMwa9u-_Ubvdh7AZBxwQlMoZicFR_SkAzvLY/edit?usp=sharing>here</a>, and a special thank you goes out to our president, <em>jsull</em>, for his bravery in live demo-ing AoC during the meeting to get us into the holiday spirit.</p> <p><img src=../assets/img/advent-of-code.jpg alt=ASCII art Santa hat style=width:700px;border:3px solid red;></p> ]]></content>

Topics included ssh-ing like a pro (including jumpbox and config files), tmuxing to boost productivity, vimming like a boss, and learning how to use VSCode in a manner that is polite to the student machines.</p> <p><img src=../assets/img/2022-02-08-brilliant-orator.jpg alt=wunderkind delivers presentation> <img src=../assets/img/2022-02-08-captivated-audience.jpg alt=attentive all-male audience></p> <p>All of dblitt’s presentation materials can be found <a href=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jtLAzKpHZuUhG42IHqsj7hXcSshL9X6yCAFMoaJ15P8/edit?usp=sharing>here</a>, and we look forward to continuing with the next installment of the “Student Machines Go Brrr” series.</p> <p><img src=../assets/img/2022-02-08-student-machines-brr-meme.png alt=student machines go brrr></p> ]]></content>

For this week’s meeting, we returned to the “Student Machines Go Brrr” series hosted by our beloved VP, only this time the audience was forced to picture themselves in a cruel and tyrannical world (<em>fictional, of course</em>) where they can’t student machine like a boss because they can’t install packages 😞.</p> <p>Luckily, today’s meeting installment was here to save the day and teach all about installing packages on Linux and macOS. Topics included apt, brew, pkgsrc, and perhaps most importantly, an MD-approved way of installing packages on the student machines without sudo (😱).</p> <p>If you wish to join the fight against the encroachment of your freedom to install packages, be sure to check out today’s slides on packages <a href=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1l1EErqTsyjdhVHfizuTMLDySch3dI9BAO8vG_5YxQH4/edit?usp=sharing>here</a> 💪.</p> <p><img src=../assets/img/2022-02-08-student-machines-brr-meme.png alt=student machines go brrr></p> <p>A huge thank you goes out to dblitt and all of the officers who helped put together content for this series &lt;3</p> ]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>It’s midterm season at ND, and we know that everyone has a lot on their plate 🥄🥄. Naturally, our response to this was adding more…</p> <p>For this week’s meeting we decided it prudent to use our time slot in the lovely 356A to host pizza and games as an opportunity to unwind and de-stress. We look forward to catching everyone after the break — Go Irish, Beat Midterms.</p> <div style=text-align: center> <iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/i43tkaTXtwI title=YouTube video player frameborder=0 allow=accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share allowfullscreen> </iframe> </div> ]]></content>
