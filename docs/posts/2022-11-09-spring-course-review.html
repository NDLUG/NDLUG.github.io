        <p>It has become tradition for the storied officers and friends of LUG to get together and combine their rich perspectives to offer a review of the <a href="https://cse.nd.edu/">CSE department‚Äôs</a> course offerings. With the 2023 spring semester fast approaching, we thought dedicating today‚Äôs meeting to that purpose would be very fitting. A special thank you goes out to all of the panelists whose valuable insights made today‚Äôs discussion incredibly helpful and informative &lt;3.</p>
        <p>A recording of the meeting may be found below:</p>

        <p>Please note that any advice or recommendations made during the discussion are the opinions of the speakers based on personal experiences that may vary depending on individual circumstances.</p>
        <p>Of the courses we reviewed and the ensuing discussions, we found the following areas to be especially valuable: - course sequencing for optimal SWE/career readiness or balanced workloads - thoughts on taking challenging but rewarding courses while at ND - general wisdom and success strategies for particular courses, etc.</p>
        <p>For these and any specifics regarding a particular course, please feel free to consult the recording!</p>
